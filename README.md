## About The Project

In this project, the existing tools were redeveloped (simpler version) and then combined.

### What is the purpose?
In addition to offering both ease of use and multiple options on a single terminal; at the same time, I basically learned how exactly these tools work.

## Installation and Usage 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/ahmetburaki/SKY-SEC_Scanner.git
cd SKY-SEC_Scanner
python3 SKYSEC_Scanners_Tool.py or python SKYSEC_Scanners_Tool.py
```
